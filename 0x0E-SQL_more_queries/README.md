# SQL

We started practicing more complex sql queries.

## Important sql code usage
* Start mysql container in ubuntu `sudo systemctl start mysql.service`
* Open normal mysql  `sudo mysql`
* Open specific user mysql (with password)  `mysql -u "username" -p`  then enter password
* Stop mysql container after usage/exit of mysql  `sudo systemctl stop mysql.service`

## How to import a SQL dump
```
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
Enter password: 
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password: 
$ echo "SELECT * FROM tv_genres" | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
